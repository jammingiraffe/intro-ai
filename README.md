Homework 3:
The assignment was to create a program that allows the user to play a game of [Hunt the Wumpus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus) via the command line. The user can input a file from which the program draws the positions of the various in-game objects, then input commands for where their character should move. With each turn, the program updates a knowledge base containing facts that can be deduced about the positions of objects based on the user's moves. It outputs hints about the user's surroundings based on these deductions.
